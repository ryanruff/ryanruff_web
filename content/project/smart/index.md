To combat the “silent epidemic” of dental caries, the world’s most prevalent noncommunicable disease, multiple state and federal agencies recommend school-based caries prevention programs (SBCP). These public health interventions can increase access to critical care for underserved populations, reduce inequities, and mitigate the severe health and socioemotional consequences of untreated caries. However, despite the use of evidence-based interventions, between 20-30% of children participating in school-based caries prevention fail to respond to treatment, developing new caries and remaining at high risk for subsequent complications. Additionally, the reach of school-based prevention is severely limited due to the need for trained dental hygienists to provide care. We propose to develop and assess personalized approaches to SBCP using adaptive interventions (AI), simultaneously testing multiple types, intensities, and modalities of treatment delivery in school-based care. Evaluated by embedding dynamic treatment regimes (DTR) within a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) design, we will explore a number of hypotheses related to adaptive interventions with the goal of reducing treatment nonresponse and health inequities. First, we will test the direct and moderating effects of combinative and high-intensity treatments, estimating proximal outcomes using marginal causal excursion and distal outcomes using inverse probability weighted mixed effects modeling. We will then test the non-inferiority of alternative providers nested within a DTR using silver diamine fluoride, comparing school nurses to dental hygienists, with the potential to expand the professional workforce that is able to provide care in school-based caries prevention. We conclude with a microcosting analysis of the adaptive interventions, ultimately quantifying the intervention costs under different implementation scenarios and taking the first step towards understanding how much payers should reimburse for adaptive interventions. To facilitate completion of these aims, we will implement our adaptive prevention model in the CariedAway network: a multistate collaborative of over 80 schools with predominantly high-risk children, committed to innovative approaches to caries prevention. This will reduce the need for costly recruitment and has a demonstrated history of both successful clinical care and research.
