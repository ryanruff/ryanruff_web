My name is Kristen He and I will be joining the RASH lab as a research affiliate. As a second-year biostatistics student at Columbia University, I am deeply interested in the intersection of data science and oral health, which has led me to a unique path toward dental school next fall. I am excited to join the CariedAway Project at NYU and I plan to apply my data analysis skills towards solutions aimed at reducing cavities.
